# vehicles_app

This project is a tool to analyze and interpret  a US population dataset of cars for sale. There are plots and charts showing the distribution of vehicles being sold along with a filtering option through the sidebar.I develop and deployed this web application to a cloud service so that it is accessible to the public.

# EDA
After reading the CSV file with pandas , I did an EDA on the dataset. I was able to see areas to enhance and fix such as missing values and creating new useful data into the dataset. 

# Data Visualization
I created plots and graphs of the vehicles dataframe to showcase diffrences and visualize the dataset. Using plotly express and streamlit to organize the layout.

# This project is used to showcase:
    - Reading, analyzing, and interpereting data
    - Exploratory data analysis on a given dataset
    - Skillsets in data visualization methods 
    - Software Development Tools
